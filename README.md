# pinboard

Proof of concept for creating a tactile display using a 'pinart' board, uses a kinect to feed depth information from a chosen pixel through to an arduino, which in turn triggers a servo to push/pull a pin on the pinboard.

* If you have lots of money for linear actuators and would like to see this manufactured as a product, please get in touch! 

Selling points:

* Fun.
* Tactile display for the blind.
* Can use a depth camera as input (such as a kinect in this demo), can use any 3D rendered content, including games and VFX, or any 2D films with a stereo conversion - as long as a ZDepth pass can be produced, it can be displayed.
* Each pin could also light up with an embedded LED to make it coloured!!

To-do:

* Miniturisation of the actuation process (tiny linear actuators required!) & control boards.
* Making a pinboard that doesn't fall apart like the cheap toy versions I demo with.
* Larger Resolution.
